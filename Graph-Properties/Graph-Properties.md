## Hello! This is the Graph Properties markdown file!

# Program Objective 

The objective of this program is to answer essential questions about a graph. How many edges? How many nodes? How many neighbors? Can we get from node u to node v and if so does there exist a shortest path? 

# How to compile and run the program

So far, there are the following tests: graph_properties, shortest_unweighted, shortest_weighted, connected_components, and smallest_threshold.

1. Adjust your directory, type 'make' in console to active Makefile.
2. Run the following './GraphTest ./Examples/small-graph.csv x' where x denotes one of the test specified above.
