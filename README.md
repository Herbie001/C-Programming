# Welcome to my Programming Repo!

In this repository you will find code that I've written. Each subdirectory contains a markdown file
which explains the following in detail:
1. Objective, why does this program matter? What's the motivation? 
2. How to compile and run the program.
3. Time complexity coupled with an explanation.
4. A few examples. 

In each subdirectory you will find documentation for each function in the .h files.
