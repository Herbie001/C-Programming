# Welcome!

In this repository you will find code that I've written. Each subdirectory contains a textfile
which explains the following in detail:
1. Objective, why does this program matter? What's the motivation? 
2. How to compile and run the program.

In each cpp file you will also find documentation for each function describing its purpose.
